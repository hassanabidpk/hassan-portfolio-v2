Until now camera development has been very painful within android development. Although Camera2 API solved some of the problems in the original Camera API, however there were still lots of difficulties existed to write camera features. With the recent launch of JetPack CameraX support library, it aims to make camera app development easier by providing consistency and easy-to-use API that works on devices running Lollipop API-21 or above. In this talk, we will review main uses cases of CameraX Api which are preview, image analysis and image capture. We will also explore device-specific extensions such as portrait, HDR, night and beauty mode.
