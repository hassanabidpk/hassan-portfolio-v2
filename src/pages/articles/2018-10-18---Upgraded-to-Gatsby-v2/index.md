Startup Jam is specially designed for seed stage startups who want to improve their current products or solution using Google technologies. This one-day event offers product sprint and tech case studies. Startups go away not just with education, but also with specific ideas that they can implement in their business. This startup Jam will focus on Android, helping startups understand various opportunities with Android & identify specific opportunities within their business where an Android app could make a difference.
