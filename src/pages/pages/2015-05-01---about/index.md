Before that, I lived in Seoul where I worked for NexStreaming Corp. with the NexPlayer SDK team. I worked on [KineMaster](https://www.kinemaster.com), an Android Video editing app, in the same company. 


I love writing and sharing my experiences about Android, iOS and Web development with fellow developers through blogs posts, events and conferences. When I am not coding, You can find me hiking, running or cycling with my GoPro.
